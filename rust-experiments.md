## Background

Been wanting to learn Rust for a while now, got scared off trying to implement a linked list in Rust about two years agoâ€“now that I'm more experienced and jaded, I'm willing to give it another (mostly casual) shot.

## Learning Resources

1. [A half-hour to learn Rust](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust): A really good resource that I'm currently making my way through.
2. [Rust for TypeScript devs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNFdkTIzdXM&t=183s): Making analogies between Rust's borrow-checker and some of TypeScript's principles on immutability / mutability.

## To revisit when I get better at Rust
