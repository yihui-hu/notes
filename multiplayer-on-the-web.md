## CRDTs

Conflict-free Replicated Data Types, a modern alternative to Object Transformations (which is still a very popular standard for implementing collaborative experiences on the web; Google Docs still uses OT)

## Yjs

A popular, robust, battle-tested? JavaScript library that utilises WebSockets to create collaborative experiences on the web.
